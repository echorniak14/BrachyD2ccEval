## TODO
- improve previous brachy dose summation
- Fix the total planned dose column in the report.
- [x] Dose to meet constraint and constraint met status in DVH results table should use user-input constraints.
- [x] Dose constraint templates
- [ ] test all dose constraint templates
- Remove BED in report
- [x] fix contrast on dark mode
- [ ] fix point dose reporting and constraint evaluation (need details for point dose constraints eg bladder point, metrics and constraint values)

## Future Enhancements

### User Interface & Experience
- [ ] Interactive DVH Plots
- [x] Visual Constraint Indicatorsoka
- [x] Customizable Constraints
- [ ] Batch Processing
- [ ] Report Customization
- [ ] Templates and Presets for alpha/beta ratios, point selections and dose constraints.

### Backend & Calculation Engine
- [ ] Expanded DICOM Support (e.g., CT/MR images)
- [ ] Isodose Line Visualization
- [ ] Advanced Biological Modeling
- [ ] Database Integration
- [ ] Robust Unit Testing

### Deployment & Integration
- [ ] Web Application Deployment
- [ ] PACS Integration
- [ ] API for Automation
